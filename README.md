My name is Edward Karlo, several years retired from a 50 year career in IT.

I have created a new entry for the NFT market. I believe it is most interesting and significant and have written this ‘Prospectus’ to
describe a complex and abstract story. I call it an A2B-NFT (Art / Asset Backed-NFT) as it is an NFT with historical physical art,
documents and computer hard and soft wares. Perhaps there are already names for such as this.
This is a draft ‘Prospectus’ for eventual minting and marketing of the A2B-NFT.

In high school (66-68) my favorite classes were science, math and especially radio and electronics. During this time I also attended
the Emily Griffith Opportunity School in Downtown Denver taking courses in electricity, general electronics, computer circuits and
programming fundamentals. This continued after graduation.

In late 1969 a recruiter from a company called “Scientific Software Corporation” (SSC) came calling looking for a computer operator
on their Burroughs B5500 mainframe. A seminal moment in my career and good for the company as well.

SSC mainly did computer modeling and accounting services for oil companies. Very scientific. Place was loaded with PhDs.
Physicists, math wizards, programmers and I was a lowly computer operator slaving away in the engine room. It was glorious.

A month in, the job is going great and the boss asks my draft status. "1A". The Vietnam war was on and a draft lottery was
instituted for men born 1950-1953 for the 1970-1973 draft. For fairness and order. I was in the 1971 lottery and had a high number
giving me a "1Y" status - draft only if aliens from outer space attack.

In the early 1970s there were reports the 1970 lottery was not random. Draftees in the later months of the year were more likely to
draw a low number. The company had a program called "PrinterMap" or "ShadowMap" that was used to make simple contour maps
of oil fields and wells on the line printer. Each line would be printed eight times and by overprinting could make all sorts of
characters. I thought it would be interesting to input the 1970 lottery numbers into the program to see what it would reveal. The
poor little ALGOL program did its best to make a contour map out of random numbers and went loopy. It revealed nothing but the
resulting, accidental, printout stretching nearly 3 1/2 pages of 14 7/8 x 11” computer paper was so striking I framed it and called it
"The Shadow Speaks". It has been on my office wall at work and home for over 50 years.

Title is a play on the intro to the 1930s radio program “The Shadow”.<br>

The introductory line from the radio adaptation of The Shadow – "Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow
knows!" – spoken by actor Frank Readick, has earned a place in the American idiom. These words were accompanied by an
ominous laugh and a musical theme, Camille Saint-Saëns' Le Rouet d'Omphale ("Omphale's Spinning Wheel," composed in 1872).<br>
