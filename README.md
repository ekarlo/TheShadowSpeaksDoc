My name is Edward Karlo, several years retired from a 50 year career in IT.

I have created a new entry for the NFT market. I believe it is most interesting and significant and have written this ‘Prospectus’ to<br>
describe a complex and abstract story. I call it an A2B-NFT (Art / Asset Backed-NFT) as it is an NFT with historical physical art,<br>
documents and computer hard and soft wares. Perhaps there are already names for such as this.<br>
This is a draft ‘Prospectus’ for eventual minting and marketing of the A2B-NFT.<br>

In high school (66-68) my favorite classes were science, math and especially radio and electronics. During this time I also attended<br>
the Emily Griffith Opportunity School in Downtown Denver taking courses in electricity, general electronics, computer circuits and<br>
programming fundamentals. This continued after graduation.<br>

In late 1969 a recruiter from a company called “Scientific Software Corporation” (SSC) came calling looking for a computer operator<br>
on their Burroughs B5500 mainframe. A seminal moment in my career and good for the company as well.<br>

SSC mainly did computer modeling and accounting services for oil companies. Very scientific. Place was loaded with PhDs.<br>
Physicists, math wizards, programmers and I was a lowly computer operator slaving away in the engine room. It was glorious.<br>

A month in, the job is going great and the boss asks my draft status. "1A". The Vietnam war was on and a draft lottery was<br>
instituted for men born 1950-1953 for the 1970-1973 draft. For fairness and order. I was in the 1971 lottery and had a high number<br>
giving me a "1Y" status - draft only if aliens from outer space attack.<br>

In the early 1970s there were reports the 1970 lottery was not random. Draftees in the later months of the year were more likely to<br>
draw a low number. The company had a program called "PrinterMap" or "ShadowMap" that was used to make simple contour maps<br>
of oil fields and wells on the line printer. Each line would be printed eight times and by overprinting could make all sorts of<br>
characters. I thought it would be interesting to input the 1970 lottery numbers into the program to see what it would reveal. The<br>
poor little ALGOL program did its best to make a contour map out of random numbers and went loopy. It revealed nothing but the<br>
resulting, accidental, printout stretching nearly 3 1/2 pages of 14 7/8 x 11” computer paper was so striking I framed it and called it<br>
"The Shadow Speaks". It has been on my office wall at work and home for over 50 years.<br>
